The authentication mechanism needs to be configured only in the AuthenticationClass which is then referenced in the product. Multiple different authentication providers are supported.

                            If a product extracts some sort of "effective user" that is represented by a string internally, this config determines with claim is used to extract that string. It is desirable to use `sub` in here (or some other stable identifier), but in many cases you might need to use `preferred_username` (e.g. in case of Keycloak) or a different claim instead.

                            Please note that some products hard-coded the claim in their implementation, so some product operators might error out if the product hardcodes a different claim than configured here.

                            We don't provide any default value, as there is no correct way of doing it that works in all setups. Most demos will probably use `preferred_username`, although `sub` being more desirable, but technically impossible with the current behavior of the products.
