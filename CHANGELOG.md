## [24.11.0] - 2024-11-18

### Added

- The operator can now run on Kubernetes clusters using a non-default cluster domain.
  Use the env var `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` or the operator Helm chart property `kubernetesClusterDomain` to set a non-default cluster domain ([#290]).

### Changed

- BREAKING: Bump `stackable-operator` to 0.78.0 which includes a new `AuthenticationClassProvider` member for Kerberos. This will need to be considered when validating authentication providers ([#285]).

### Fixed

- BREAKING: The fields `connection` and `host` on `S3Connection` as well as `bucketName` on `S3Bucket`are now mandatory. Previously operators errored out in case these fields where missing ([#283]).
- Failing to parse one `ZookeeperCluster`/`ZookeeperZnode` should no longer cause the whole operator to stop functioning ([#293]).
- The StatefulSet restarter service now only retrieves metadata for ConfigMaps and Secrets, rather than full objects ([#293]).
