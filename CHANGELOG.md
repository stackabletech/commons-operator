# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Helm: Allow Pod `priorityClassName` to be configured ([#376]).
- Add end-of-support checker ([#377]).
  - `EOS_CHECK_MODE` (`--eos-check-mode`) to set the EoS check mode. Currently, only "offline" is supported.
  - `EOS_INTERVAL` (`--eos-interval`) to set the interval in which the operator checks if it is EoS.
  - `EOS_DISABLED` (`--eos-disabled`) to disable the EoS checker completely.

### Changed

- Bump stackable-operator to `0.100.1` ([#381]).
- Reduce severity of Pod eviction errors. Previously, the operator would produce lot's of
  `Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget` errors. With this fix, the
  error is reduced to an info instead ([#372]).
- Remove workaround for limiting rescheduling delay ([#378]).

## [25.7.0] - 2025-07-23

## [25.7.0-rc1] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- Adds new telemetry CLI arguments and environment variables ([#349]).
  - Use `--file-log-max-files` (or `FILE_LOG_MAX_FILES`) to limit the number of log files kept.
  - Use `--file-log-rotation-period` (or `FILE_LOG_ROTATION_PERIOD`) to configure the frequency of rotation.
  - Use `--console-log-format` (or `CONSOLE_LOG_FORMAT`) to set the format to `plain` (default) or `json`.
- Add RBAC rule to Helm template for automatic cluster domain detection ([#365]).

### Changed

- Replace stackable-operator `initialize_logging` with stackable-telemetry `Tracing` ([#338], [#344], [#349]).
  - BREAKING: The console log level was set by `COMMONS_OPERATOR_LOG`, and is now set by `CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL`.
  - BREAKING: The file log level was set by `COMMONS_OPERATOR_LOG`, and is now set by `FILE_LOG_LEVEL`.
  - BREAKING: The file log directory was set by `COMMONS_OPERATOR_LOG_DIRECTORY`, and is now set
    by `FILE_LOG_DIRECTORY` (or via `--file-log-directory <DIRECTORY>`).
  - Replace stackable-operator `print_startup_string` with `tracing::info!` with fields.
- Version CRDs and bump dependencies ([#353]).
- Limit rescheduling delay to a maximum of 6 months ([#363]).
- BREAKING: Bump stackable-operator to 0.94.0 and update other dependencies ([#365]).
  - The default Kubernetes cluster domain name is now fetched from the kubelet API unless explicitly configured.
  - This requires operators to have the RBAC permission to get nodes/proxy in the apiGroup "". The helm-chart takes care of this.
  - The CLI argument `--kubernetes-node-name` or env variable `KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME` needs to be set. The helm-chart takes care of this.

### Fixed

- Use `json` file extension for log files ([#343]).
- Allow uppercase characters in domain names ([#365]).

### Removed

- Remove the `lastUpdateTime` field from the stacklet status ([#365]).
- Remove role binding to legacy service accounts ([#365]).

## [24.11.1] - 2025-01-09

## [24.11.0] - 2024-11-18

### Added

- The operator can now run on Kubernetes clusters using a non-default cluster domain.
  Use the env var `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` or the operator Helm chart property `kubernetesClusterDomain` to set a non-default cluster domain ([#290]).

### Changed

- BREAKING: Bump `stackable-operator` to 0.78.0 which includes a new `AuthenticationClassProvider` member for Kerberos. This will need to be considered when validating authentication providers ([#285]).

### Fixed

- BREAKING: The fields `connection` and `host` on `S3Connection` as well as `bucketName` on `S3Bucket`are now mandatory. Previously operators errored out in case these fields where missing ([#283]).
- Failing to parse one `ZookeeperCluster`/`ZookeeperZnode` should no longer cause the whole operator to stop functioning ([#293]).
- The StatefulSet restarter service now only retrieves metadata for ConfigMaps and Secrets, rather than full objects ([#293]).
