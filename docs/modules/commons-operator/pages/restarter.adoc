= Restarter

The Stackable Commons Operator can automatically restart `Pod` objects based on certain criteria. This can be applied to
either the `Pod` or certain controller objects (such as `StatefulSet`).

== `Pod`

Pods are evicted when any of their restart criteria (listed below) expire, with the expectation that their owning controller
is then responsible for restarting them.

Because they are evicted rather than deleted, this process should respect `PodDisruptionBudget` constraints, allowing users
to ensure that clusters are restarted gracefully.

=== Expiration date

Annotation:: `restarter.stackable.tech/expires-at.\{tag\}`

Pods can be configured to expire at a certain point in time. In this case, the `Pod` should have the annotation
`restarter.stackable.tech/expires-at.\{tag\}` set to a datetime formatted according to RFC 3339 (such as
`"2022-04-21T13:24:15.225774724+00:00"`).
`\{tag\}` should be a deterministic but unique ID identifying the reason for the expiry.

Multiple `expires-at` annotations can be set on the same `Pod`, in which case the *earliest* expiration datetime
takes precedence.

== `StatefulSet`

StatefulSets are rolling-restarted when any of their restart criteria (listed below) expire.

=== Stale configuration

Label:: `restarter.stackable.tech/enabled`

StatefulSets can be configured to restart when any referenced configuration object (`ConfigMap` or `Secret`) changes.
To enable this, set the `restarter.stackable.tech/enabled` label on the `StatefulSet` to `true`.
