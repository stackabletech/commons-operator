= Pod enricher
:description: Automatically enrich Pods with Node address info using Stackable Commons Operator by enabling the enrichment label.

The Stackable Commons Operator automatically adds commonly used information to Pod objects, which would otherwise have to be inferred by traversing the Kubernetes object graph.

== Usage

To enable the pod enricher for a Pod, set the label `enrichment.stackable.tech/enabled` to `true`.

== Which information is added to the Pod?

Annotation:: `enrichment.stackable.tech/node-address`

The hostname or IP address of the Node that the Pod is scheduled to run on.
Compared to `Pod.status.nodeIP`, this can also (but doesn't have to) be a hostname, and prefers externally routable addresses.

This is intended to be used for components that need to register an accessible address (such as Kafka brokers, or HDFS DataNodes).
