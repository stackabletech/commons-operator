= Installation

There are two ways to run the Stackable Commons Operator:

1. Helm managed Docker container deployment on Kubernetes

2. Build from source


== Helm
Helm allows you to download and deploy Stackable operators on Kubernetes and is by far the easiest installation method. First ensure that you have installed the Stackable Operators Helm repository:

[source,console]
----
$ helm repo add stackable https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-stable/
----

Then install the Stackable Commons Operator

[source,console]
----
$ helm install commons-operator stackable/commons-operator
----

Helm will deploy the operator in Kubernetes and apply the CRDs.

== Building the operator from source

After cloning the commons-operator repor you can use the following command to apply the CRDs:

[source,console]
----
$ cargo run -- crd | kubectl apply -f -
----

Use the following command to run the operator:

[source,console]
----
$ cargo run -- run
----
