= Installation

There are two ways to run the Stackable Commons Operator:

1. Helm managed Docker container deployment on Kubernetes

2. Build from source

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== Helm
Helm allows you to download and deploy Stackable operators on Kubernetes and is by far the easiest installation method. First ensure that you have installed the Stackable Operators Helm repository:

[source,console]
----
$ helm repo add stackable https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-stable/
----

Then install the Stackable Commons Operator

[source,console]
----
$ helm install commons-operator stackable/commons-operator
----

Helm will deploy the operator in Kubernetes and apply the CRDs.

== Building the operator from source

After cloning the commons-operator repo you can use the following command to apply the CRDs:

[source,console]
----
$ cargo run -- crd | kubectl apply -f -
----

Use the following command to run the operator:

[source,console]
----
$ cargo run -- run
----
