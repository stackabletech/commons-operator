= Pod Enricher

The Stackable Commons Operator automatically adds commonly used information to `Pod` objects, which
would otherwise have to be inferred by traversing the Kubernetes object graph.

== Node Address

Annotation:: `enrichment.stackable.tech/node-address`

The hostname or IP address of the `Node` that the `Pod` is scheduled to run on.
Compared to `Pod.status.nodeIP`, this can also (but doesn't have to) be a hostname, and prefers
externally routable addresses.

This is intended to be used for components that need to register an accessible address (such as Kafka brokers,
or HDFS DataNodes).
